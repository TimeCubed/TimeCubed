hiya, I'm TimeCubed. I'm usually known as TimeSquared on most places, but the username TimeSquared is taken by someone else.
I stopped programming for a while, but I've slowly started to get back into the hobby. most of my projects are open source and licensed under the MIT
license, so you can use my code in your projects freely (though, I doubt anyone would use my code. hell, I doubt I'd use my own code..). most of my
repos here are for my minecraft mods which I used to make, but you'll also find some other stuff too that you can maybe mess around with if you want.

my dms are pretty open, so if you do want to contact me, just message me on discord (my handle's `timesquared`)! I'm usually online a lot of the time,
so I'll probably look at your message somewhat quickly (but do introduce yourself at least).

thanks for checking out my github!
