Hey there, I'm TimeCubed, also known as TimeSquared in most places (but some guy took the username on github already so I'm stuck with this).
I do random stuff, most include programming or making mods for minecraft, which, hey that's what this whole Github is about. All of my mods here
are open source so you can go mess around with them if you'd like (please do, I'm too lazy to go improve them myself). You'll probably find some
other projects sprinkled about in here, which you could also go mess around with (a.k.a: you know what to do, go make a pr or something).

If you do wanna go talk to me about something (at all) then you could just go message me on discord (my handle's `timesquared`), I'll probably look
at what you're saying very quickly (but please do introduce yourself, tell me you're from my github or something, or tell me if you're a spam bot,
anything goes).

Anyways, thanks for checking out my Github I guess?

- Sincerely, walter square * 6 (some certain cuphead looking discord person would get this)

Hi, I'm TimeCubed. I'm most known by TimeSquared on most places, but unforunately the username TimeSquared is taken on GitHub. I am a high school student, and I enjoy doing a bunch of random hobbies and stuff that interests me. I'm currently learning the C programming language, and I've coded in **Java/C/C++/HTML/CSS/Python** before, but I'm mainly coding in Java nowadays. You can contact me by sending me a DM on Discord, where my Discord handle is `timesquared`. I am usually very active on Discord, and I will usually look at any DM requests I get, so feel free to ask me about anything I make. This GitHub profile is mainly for sharing the stuff I do and currently working on, and I aprreciate any contributions to any of my projects, new or old. My code is always going to be free and open source, and all of the stuff here on my GitHub profile is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to use, change, or even distribute my code as long as you provide credit for my work.
